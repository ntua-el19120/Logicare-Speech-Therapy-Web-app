# Logicare Speech Therapy Web App

A full-stack web application for managing and delivering speech therapy exercises.  
This project is fully containerized using **Docker** and runs with a **PostgreSQL** database, **Node.js backend**, and **React (Vite) frontend**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- PostgreSQL database with schema + initial data (from `db/dump1.sql`)
- Backend (Node.js + Express) with REST APIs
- Frontend (React + Vite) with proxy to backend
- Ready-to-run with Docker Compose

---

## 📦 Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ntua-el19120/Logicare-Speech-Therapy-Web-app.git
   cd Logicare-Speech-Therapy-Web-app
````

2. **Start the services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This will build and run:

   * `db` → PostgreSQL with schema + data loaded from `db/dump1.sql`
   * `backend` → Node.js server (Express API)
   * `frontend` → React app (served by Vite)

3. **Access the app**

   * Frontend: [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173)
   * Backend API: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
   * Database: exposed at `localhost:5432` (user: `postgres`, password: `postgres`, db: `speech_therapy`)

---

## 🗄️ Database Notes

* The PostgreSQL database is initialized with `db/dump1.sql`.
* If you need to reset/reload the DB:

  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  docker compose up --build
  ```

---

## 🛠 Development

* **Frontend**: in `/frontend`

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
* **Backend**: in `/backend`

  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```
